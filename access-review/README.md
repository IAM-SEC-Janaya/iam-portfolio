# Access Review & Certification

This section documents access review and certification processes used to validate that user access remains appropriate over time. Access reviews are a critical identity governance control and are required in most regulated and audited environments.

Rather than focusing on how access is granted, this section focuses on how access is **reviewed, validated, and corrected** after provisioning.
