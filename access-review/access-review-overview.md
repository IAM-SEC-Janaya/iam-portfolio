- Reduce insider and account misuse risk

- Role-based access assignments
- Application access tied to job function

## Review Process

1. IAM system generates a list of users and their access
2. Managers or role owners review access appropriateness
3. Access is approved, revoked, or flagged for follow-up
4. Decisions are recorded for audit evidence
5. Remediation actions are tracked to completion

## Governance Considerations

Effective access reviews require:
- Clear role definitions
- Defined review owners
- Time-bound review windows
- Evidence retention for audits

This process complements provisioning and RBAC by ensuring access remains correct over time.
