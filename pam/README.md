# Privileged Access Management (PAM)

This section documents how privileged access is requested, granted, monitored, and governed in an enterprise security environment. Privileged Access Management (PAM) focuses on securing accounts and access paths that have elevated permissions and pose the highest risk to systems and data.

This section builds on identity lifecycle management and access control models by addressing how administrative and high-impact access is controlled.

## Scope of This Section

This section demonstrates:
- Privileged access request and approval workflows
- Just-in-Time (JIT) privileged access
- Session monitoring and audit logging
- Emergency (break-glass) access handling
- Governance and security controls for privileged accounts

Artifacts are written in a vendor-neutral manner, with CyberArk examples included to reflect real-world PAM implementation experience.

## Recommended Reading Order

1. **PAM Overview** (`pam-overview.md`)  
   Start here for an overview of privileged access risks, core PAM concepts, and why PAM is critical to security programs.

2. **Privileged Access Request Workflow** (`privileged-access-request-workflow.md`)  
   Review the standard workflow for requesting, approving, granting, and revoking privileged access.

3. **Break-Glass Privileged Access** (`break-glass-privileged-access.md`)  
   Learn how emergency privileged access is handled when normal workflows cannot be followed.

4. **PAM Controls Checklist** (`pam-controls-checklist.md`)  
   Conclude with a checklist of governance, security, and audit controls that support effective PAM operations.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Privileged account risk management
- Least privilege enforcement for elevated access
- Time-bound and approval-based access
- Session monitoring and accountability
- Audit readiness and compliance alignment

This section demonstrates how privileged access is managed securely without relying on permanent administrative permissions.
