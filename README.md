# Identity & Access Management (IAM) Portfolio  
*Built by Janaya — Cybersecurity Specialist with IAM & PAM experience*

---

## Welcome

This repository is a hands-on IAM portfolio demonstrating how identity, access, and privileged access are designed, governed, and secured in enterprise environments.

The focus is on **practical IAM implementation**, including lifecycle management, access control models, access reviews, and privileged access governance. Artifacts are written to reflect real-world enterprise and regulated-environment practices.

## What You’ll Find in This Portfolio

### Core IAM Domains (Implemented)

- **Identity Lifecycle Management**  
  Provisioning, role changes, deprovisioning workflows, automation examples, and lifecycle diagrams.

- **Access Control Models**  
  Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), role matrices, and hybrid model comparisons.

- **Access Reviews & Certification**  
  Governance-focused access review workflows, certification samples, and remediation tracking.

- **Privileged Access Management (PAM)**  
  Privileged access request workflows, break-glass access handling, governance controls, and CyberArk-aligned examples.

## Healthcare IAM Focus (Applied Learning)

This portfolio includes a dedicated **Healthcare IAM extension** that demonstrates how IAM principles are applied in healthcare environments to protect ePHI while supporting clinical workflows.

While I do not yet have direct production healthcare IAM experience, this section reflects applied learning based on formal coursework, industry standards, and enterprise IAM practices. The artifacts translate healthcare regulatory requirements into practical IAM designs and governance documentation.

**Healthcare IAM topics covered include:**
- EHR-focused RBAC role design
- Clinical vs administrative access separation
- Break-glass (emergency) access for patient care
- HIPAA Security Rule alignment
- Healthcare IAM alignment with NIST 800-53

## Skills Demonstrated

- Identity Governance & Administration (IGA)
- Privileged Access Management (PAM)
- RBAC & ABAC access design
- Least privilege enforcement
- Access reviews and certification
- Audit readiness and evidence documentation
- IAM & PAM workflow documentation
- PowerShell-based IAM automation concepts

## Repository Structure

- `identity-lifecycle/`  
  Identity provisioning, role changes, deprovisioning, workflow diagrams, and automation examples

- `access-control-models/`  
  RBAC role matrices, ABAC concepts, and access model comparisons

- `access-review/`  
  Access certification documentation, review samples, and remediation tracking

- `pam/`  
  Privileged access workflows, break-glass access, and PAM governance controls

Each folder includes a README outlining scope and recommended reading order.

## Planned Expansions

The following areas will be added as the portfolio continues to evolve:

- SSO and MFA implementation examples
- Compliance mapping (NIST 800-53, HIPAA Security Rule)
- Expanded automation examples
- Healthcare IAM use cases (EHR access, break-glass scenarios)

---

## Why This Matters

IAM is a foundational security capability. This portfolio demonstrates not only technical concepts, but also governance, audit awareness, and security decision-making across the identity lifecycle.

The goal is to reflect how IAM operates as a **program**, not just a set of tools.
