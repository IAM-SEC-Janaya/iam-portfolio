# Identity & Access Management (IAM) Portfolio  
*Built by Janaya — Cybersecurity Specialist with IAM & PAM experience*

---

## 👋 Welcome

This repository is a hands-on **Identity & Access Management (IAM) portfolio** demonstrating how identity, access, and privileged access are designed, governed, and secured in enterprise environments.

The focus is on **practical IAM implementation**, including identity lifecycle management, access control models, access governance, privileged access management, and compliance alignment. Artifacts are written to reflect real-world enterprise and regulated-environment practices.

---

## 🧭 Vendor-Neutral IAM Approach

All artifacts in this repository are designed using a **vendor-neutral IAM approach**.  
Concepts, workflows, and controls are based on industry standards, security frameworks, and enterprise IAM practices rather than dependence on a single product or platform.

Where vendor examples are referenced (for example, CyberArk or EHR platforms), they are used illustratively to demonstrate common implementation patterns—not to imply product dependency.

This approach ensures the work is transferable across organizations, industries, and technology stacks.

## 🧠 What You’ll Find in This Portfolio

This portfolio is organized to reflect IAM as an **enterprise security program**, not a collection of isolated tools.

### 🔹 Core IAM Domains (Implemented)

- **Identity Lifecycle Management**  
  User provisioning, role changes, and deprovisioning workflows supported by lifecycle diagrams and automation examples.

- **Access Control Models**  
  Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), role matrices, and access model comparisons supporting least-privilege access.

- **Privileged Access Management (PAM)**  
  Privileged access request workflows, break-glass access handling, governance controls, and PAM design aligned to enterprise best practices.

---

### 🔹 Governance

- **Access Reviews & Certification**  
  Governance-focused access review workflows, entitlement validation, reviewer decision tracking, and remediation documentation.

---

### 🔹 Compliance & Framework Alignment

- **Security Framework Mapping**  
  IAM control mapping aligned to **NIST SP 800-53 (IA and AC control families)** to support audit readiness and compliance activities.

---

### 🔹 Industry Use Cases (Applied Learning)

- **Healthcare IAM**  
  A healthcare-focused IAM extension demonstrating how IAM principles apply in regulated healthcare environments.  
  Artifacts include EHR-style RBAC role design, clinical vs administrative access separation, break-glass (emergency) access workflows, HIPAA Security Rule alignment, and healthcare IAM governance documentation.

> *Industry use cases demonstrate applied learning and domain adaptation, not over-claimed production experience.*

## 🎯 Why This Matters

IAM is a foundational security capability. This portfolio demonstrates not only technical IAM concepts, but also governance awareness, audit readiness, and security decision-making across the identity lifecycle.

The goal is to reflect how IAM operates as a **program**, not just a set of tools.
