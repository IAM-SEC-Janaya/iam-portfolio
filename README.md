# Identity & Access Management (IAM) Portfolio  
*Built by Janaya — Cybersecurity Specialist with IAM & PAM experience*

---

## 👋 Welcome

This repository is a hands-on **Identity & Access Management (IAM) portfolio** demonstrating how identity, access, and privileged access are designed, governed, and secured in enterprise environments.

The focus is on **practical IAM implementation**, including identity lifecycle management, access control models, access governance, privileged access management, and compliance alignment. Artifacts are written to reflect real-world enterprise and regulated-environment practices.

## 🧠 What You’ll Find in This Portfolio

This portfolio is organized to reflect IAM as an **enterprise security program**, not a collection of isolated tools.

### Core IAM Domains (Implemented)

- **Identity Lifecycle Management**  
  User provisioning, role changes, deprovisioning workflows, lifecycle diagrams, and automation examples.

- **Access Control Models**  
  Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), role matrices, and RBAC vs ABAC comparisons.

- **Privileged Access Management (PAM)**  
  Privileged access request workflows, break-glass access handling, governance controls, and CyberArk-aligned examples.

---

### Governance

- **Access Reviews & Certification**  
  Governance-focused access review workflows, certification samples, entitlement validation, and remediation tracking.

---

### Compliance & Framework Alignment

- **Security Framework Mapping**  
  IAM control alignment with NIST SP 800-53 (IA and AC families), supporting audit readiness and compliance documentation.

---

### Industry Use Cases (Applied Learning)

- **Healthcare IAM**  
  Healthcare-focused IAM artifacts demonstrating how IAM principles apply in regulated healthcare environments.  
  Includes EHR-style RBAC role design, clinical vs administrative access separation, break-glass (emergency) access workflows, HIPAA Security Rule alignment, and healthcare IAM governance documentation.

> *Industry use cases demonstrate applied learning and domain adaptation, not over-claimed production experience.*

## 🎯 Why This Matters

IAM is a foundational security capability. This portfolio demonstrates not only technical IAM concepts, but also governance awareness, audit readiness, and security decision-making across the identity lifecycle.

The goal is to reflect how IAM operates as a **program**, not just a set of tools.
