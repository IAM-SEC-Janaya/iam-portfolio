# Identity & Access Management (IAM) Portfolio  
*Built by Janaya — Cybersecurity Specialist with IAM & PAM experience*

---

## Welcome

This repository is a hands-on IAM portfolio demonstrating how identity, access, and privileged access are designed, governed, and secured in enterprise environments.

The focus is on **practical IAM implementation**, including lifecycle management, access control models, access reviews, and privileged access governance. Artifacts are written to reflect real-world enterprise and regulated-environment practices.

## What You’ll Find in This Portfolio

### Core IAM Domains (Implemented)

- **Identity Lifecycle Management**  
  Provisioning, role changes, deprovisioning workflows, automation examples, and lifecycle diagrams.

- **Access Control Models**  
  Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), role matrices, and hybrid model comparisons.

- **Access Reviews & Certification**  
  Governance-focused access review workflows, certification samples, and remediation tracking.

- **Privileged Access Management (PAM)**  
  Privileged access request workflows, break-glass access handling, governance controls, and CyberArk-aligned examples.

## Repository Structure

- `identity-lifecycle/`  
  Identity provisioning, role changes, deprovisioning, workflow diagrams, and automation examples

- `access-control-models/`  
  RBAC role matrices, ABAC concepts, and access model comparisons

- `access-review/`  
  Access certification documentation, review samples, and remediation tracking

- `pam/`  
  Privileged access workflows, break-glass access, and PAM governance controls

Each folder includes a README outlining scope and recommended reading order.

## Planned Expansions

The following areas will be added as the portfolio continues to evolve:

- SSO and MFA implementation examples
- Compliance mapping (NIST 800-53, HIPAA Security Rule)
- Expanded automation examples
- Healthcare IAM use cases (EHR access, break-glass scenarios)

---

## Why This Matters

IAM is a foundational security capability. This portfolio demonstrates not only technical concepts, but also governance, audit awareness, and security decision-making across the identity lifecycle.

The goal is to reflect how IAM operates as a **program**, not just a set of tools.
