# NIST 800-53 IAM Control Mapping

This section maps Identity and Access Management (IAM) practices demonstrated in this portfolio to relevant controls from NIST Special Publication 800-53 (Revision 5).

The purpose of this mapping is to show how IAM controls support security, governance, and compliance requirements in regulated environments.

This mapping focuses on **Identity (IA)** and **Access Control (AC)** control families, which are foundational to IAM programs.

---

## Scope of This Section

This section demonstrates:
- How IAM activities align to NIST 800-53 controls
- Practical interpretation of security controls
- Evidence-based compliance support
- Traceability between IAM implementation and security frameworks

This mapping reflects how organizations document compliance during audits rather than restating framework text.

## Control Families Covered

- **IA – Identification and Authentication**
- **AC – Access Control**

Additional mappings may be added as the portfolio expands.
