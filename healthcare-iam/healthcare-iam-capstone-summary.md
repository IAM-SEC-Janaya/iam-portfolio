# Healthcare Identity & Access Management Capstone Summary

This healthcare IAM capstone demonstrates how Identity and Access Management principles are applied in healthcare environments to protect electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) while supporting clinical workflows and patient safety.

While I do not yet have direct production experience in a healthcare IAM role, this work reflects applied learning based on formal coursework, industry standards, and enterprise IAM experience. The artifacts in this section translate healthcare regulatory requirements into practical IAM controls, workflows, and governance documentation.

## Learning Approach and Context

To prepare for healthcare IAM roles, I focused on understanding:
- HIPAA Privacy and Security Rule requirements
- Healthcare-specific access control challenges
- EHR access patterns and role-based design
- Emergency access (break-glass) requirements
- Audit and compliance expectations in regulated healthcare environments

Rather than relying on theory alone, I applied this knowledge by designing IAM artifacts that reflect how healthcare organizations manage access in practice.

## Healthcare IAM Artifacts Overview

This healthcare IAM extension includes:

- **Healthcare RBAC Role Matrix**  
  A role-based access model reflecting common clinical, administrative, and privileged roles in EHR systems. The matrix enforces minimum necessary access and clearly separates clinical care functions from non-clinical access.

- **Break-Glass EHR Access Workflow**  
  An emergency access design that balances patient safety with accountability. The workflow includes justification, time-bound access, enhanced logging, and post-event review.

- **HIPAA Security Rule to IAM Mapping**  
  A control mapping that demonstrates how IAM practices support HIPAA Security Rule requirements related to access control, unique user identification, audit controls, and emergency access.

- **NIST 800-53 Alignment**  
  A mapping that shows how healthcare IAM controls align with federal security frameworks, supporting environments with overlapping regulatory obligations.

## Key Healthcare IAM Concepts Demonstrated

Through this capstone, I demonstrate understanding of:

- Minimum necessary access to ePHI
- Clinical versus administrative access separation
- Role-based access control in EHR environments
- Emergency access governance
- Audit readiness and evidence generation
- IAM’s role in healthcare compliance and risk management

These concepts are consistent across healthcare organizations, even though specific EHR platforms and workflows vary by institution.

## Professional Positioning

My background is in enterprise and federally aligned IAM and PAM environments. This healthcare IAM capstone reflects a deliberate transition strategy: learning healthcare regulations and workflows, then applying them through IAM design and documentation.

While organization-specific EHR workflows would require onboarding and collaboration with clinical stakeholders, the IAM foundations, governance principles, and compliance alignment demonstrated here are directly transferable to healthcare IAM roles.

## Summary

Healthcare IAM requires balancing access, security, compliance, and patient care. This capstone demonstrates how IAM controls can be designed and governed to meet those requirements, even in high-risk and high-availability environments.

This work reflects readiness to contribute to healthcare IAM teams by applying strong IAM fundamentals, regulatory understanding, and documentation discipline in support of secure and compliant healthcare systems.
