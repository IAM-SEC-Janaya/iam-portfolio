# Portfolio Walkthrough (Interview Script)

## 30-Second Overview
This portfolio demonstrates how I approach IAM as an enterprise security program—covering identity lifecycle management, access control models, access governance, privileged access management, and compliance alignment. The artifacts are vendor-neutral and written to reflect real-world workflows and audit expectations.

## Identity Lifecycle (1 minute)
I start with identity lifecycle management because it’s the foundation. The lifecycle artifacts show how workforce events drive account creation, role assignment, and access removal. I included a workflow diagram, a written summary, and a vendor-neutral onboarding automation script to demonstrate both process and implementation thinking.

## Access Control Models (1 minute)
Next is access design. I documented RBAC as the baseline and added ABAC as a way to handle contextual decisions. The RBAC role matrix shows how access is governed in practice, and the RBAC vs ABAC comparison demonstrates when each model works best and how they’re used together.

## Governance & Access Reviews (1 minute)
Then I show how access stays correct over time. The access review section includes a sample review worksheet and a remediation log to demonstrate how reviewer decisions become actionable removal tasks. This addresses privilege creep and supports audit readiness.

## Privileged Access Management (1 minute)
PAM is where risk is highest, so I documented a privileged access request workflow, break-glass handling, and a controls checklist. I also included CyberArk-aligned examples as implementation references while keeping the core workflow vendor-neutral.

## Compliance + Healthcare Use Case (30–60 seconds)
Finally, I mapped IAM controls to NIST 800-53 and created a healthcare IAM extension that applies IAM concepts to HIPAA-aligned controls, EHR-style role design, and break-glass access for patient care scenarios. This demonstrates how I adapt IAM fundamentals to regulated environments, even where platform details vary.
