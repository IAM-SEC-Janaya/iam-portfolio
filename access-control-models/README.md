# Access Control Models (RBAC & ABAC)

This section documents how access decisions are designed, implemented, and governed using role-based and attribute-based access control models. Access control models define who can access systems and data, under what conditions, and with what level of privilege.

These models are a core component of enterprise IAM programs and directly support least privilege, auditability, and scalability.

## Scope of This Section

This section demonstrates:
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) design and governance
- Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) concepts
- Hybrid RBAC + ABAC implementations used in modern environments
- Standardization of access across systems
- Support for audit and compliance requirements

All artifacts are designed to be vendor-neutral and transferable across IAM platforms.

## Recommended Reading Order

1. **RBAC Overview** (`rbac-overview.md`)  
   Start here to understand role-based access control and how roles are used to standardize access.

2. **RBAC Role Matrix** (`rbac-role-matrix.xlsx`)  
   Review the role-to-access mappings that show how RBAC is documented and governed in practice.

3. **ABAC Overview** (`abac-overview.md`)  
   Learn how attribute-based access control introduces contextual and dynamic authorization decisions.

4. **RBAC vs ABAC Comparison** (`rbac-vs-abac.md`)  
   Conclude with a comparison of both models and how they are commonly used together in modern IAM implementations.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Role design and entitlement mapping
- Least privilege access enforcement
- Governance-friendly access documentation
- Scalability of access models
- Context-aware authorization decisions

This access control foundation supports identity lifecycle automation, access reviews, and privileged access management across the broader IAM portfolio.
